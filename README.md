# github-dashboard

Dashboard to show GitHub statistics for diffblue.

Will display results from public repos only unless you set up authentication as follows:

* Copy `credentials.sample.js` to `credentials.js`
* Set the `username` to your username
* Set the `accessCode` to a [github personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

You can change the organisation to another one by editing line 132 of SearchResults.js
